            Sura Fitness and Events respects the privacy rights of our users and are committed to protecting the information collected through our online products, online services and websites . Sura Fitness has adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how Sura Fitness collects, stores, and uses the information collected in connection with Sura Fitness’s Apps.
BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY APPS, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND GIVE AN EXPLICIT AND INFORMED CONSENT TO THE STORAGE, USE, AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE, REGISTER TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESS ANY APPS.

Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon their being posted on Sura Fitness’s website. Your continued use of Apps will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.
Non-personal Data
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you, which may include your age, weight, and gender. Additionally, non-personal data includes “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data Sura Fitness collects about the use of Sura Fitness Apps, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.
Sura Fitness collects non-personal data from you to make your use of the Apps more efficient and useful. For example, if you provide non-personal data about you, the App may provide certain information about your workout such as calories burned or other tailored calculations about your workout.
Sura Fitness also uses tools and third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Sura Fitness to identify you. The types of non-personal data Sura Fitness may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier (“UDID”); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; (v) game score and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Sura Fitness to enhance the Apps and other Sura Fitness products and services.
Sura Fitness shares non-personal data, including both data you provide to Sura Fitness and data which is automatically collected, with Sura Fitness’s partners and contractors for purposes of analyzing usage of the Apps, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Apps, and to further develop the Apps and other Sura Fitness services and products.
You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Sura Fitness may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
Ad Serving Technology
Sura Fitness reserves the right to use and disclose collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Sura Fitness or Sura Fitness’s partners and contractors. Sura Fitness employs third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Apps. Sura Fitness or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use your demographic and location information, non-personal data you provide to Sura Fitness, and information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. Sura Fitness or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), UDID, software, applications, hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Sura Fitness may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Apps; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Apps. Although Sura Fitness takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Sura Fitness does not have access to or control of third party technologies.
Personal Data
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.
Likely situations when you make personal data available to Sura Fitness include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Apps, contests and special events; (ii) accessing Apps using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iii) subscribing to newsletters; (iv) purchasing a product or services through Sura Fitness’s online stores; (v) using “tell a friend,” “email this page,” or other similar features; (vi) requesting technical support; and (vii) otherwise through use of Sura Fitness’s Apps where personal data is required for use and/or participation.

Sura Fitness may use collected personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Apps, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Apps (including managing advertisement serving) and to further develop the Apps and other Sura Fitness services and products. Sura Fitness may combine non-personal data with personal data.

Additionally, Sura Fitness may disclose personal data to any of its affiliated companies in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Sura Fitness may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Sura Fitness’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Sura Fitness.

Sura Fitness is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by applicable law.
Sura Fitness may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or Sura Fitness to legal liability. Sura Fitness may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Sura Fitness has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with Sura Fitness’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Sura Fitness believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Sura Fitness’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Sura Fitness. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Sura Fitness will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through Sura Fitness’s website or in another reasonable manner.

Sura Fitness does not verify the correctness of personal data.

Safeguards
Sura Fitness follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in Sura Fitness’s possession. Only those persons with a need to process your personal data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance, have access to your personal data in Sura Fitness’s possession. Personal data collected by Sura Fitness is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized on-line access to personal data, Sura Fitness maintains personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite Sura Fitness’s reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the Apps, you assume this risk, and Sura Fitness will not be liable for any misappropriation or theft of your personal data.
